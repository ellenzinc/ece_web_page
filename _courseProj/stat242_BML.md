title: Simulation Biham-Middleton-Levine (BML) Traffic Model in R
---
As a homework project for an audited statistic programming course (STAT242), the simulation is about <q><i>cars moving on a grid</i></q>.  As required in the description of the project, we populate the grid by placing cars into a <i>r x c</i> grid. It has been found by Bihan <i>et el</i> that the steady-state flow of traffic suddenly went from smooth flow to a complete jam. The projects are aboud writing R packages, vectorized operations in R and S3 methods. See the 
<a href='../scratch/stat242_video.html'>link</a> for generated animations.
