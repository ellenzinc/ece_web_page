As a homework project for an audited statistic programming course (STAT242), 
the simulation is about <q><i>cars moving on a grid</i></q>. As required in the description of the project, we populate the grid by placing cars into a <i>r x c</i> grid.
 It has been found by Bihan <i>et el</i> that the steady-state flow of traffic suddenly went from smooth flow to a complete jam. 
The project aims to practicing writing R packages, vectorized operations in R and S3 methods.
