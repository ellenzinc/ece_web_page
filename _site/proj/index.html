						<h2>Research Projects</h2>
<h3>Outage Balancing for Femtocell Networks</h3>
<p><font color="A52A2A"><b>Keywords:</b> Non-convex Optimization, Mixed-Interger Programming Problem, Non-linear Perron-Frobenius Theorem, Heterogeneous Networks </font></p>
<p> <img src="../images/systemModel.png" style="float:right;width:300px;height:220px"> Given channel statistics information either locally at each femtocell base-station (FBS) or 
collected at some control node, we aim at optimizing certain system parameters based on the outage probability for FUEs and MUEs.
In a two-tier heterogenous network, interference comes from both the intra-tier (femto-to-femto, macro-to-macro)
 and cross-tier (femto-to-macro, macro-to-femto). Based on similar model, we managed to solve the following two problems</p>
<ol>
	<li>With resource allocation fixed, jointly optimize the rate allocation and power allocation for each link. </li>
	<li>With rate requirement fixed,  jointly optimizing resource allocation and power allocation for each link. </li>
</ol>
In both cases, we try to optimize outage-probability based network metrics, which provide certain fairness among
base-stations as well.
<!--In both cases, we are trying to optimize a network metric based on outage probability, which provide certain fairness among
base-stations as well. While Problem 1 is reduced to a geometric programming problem, Problem 2 is much more challenging 
with a mixed-integer non-convex nature. To tackle the challenge, the joint optimization is decomposed into an iterative 
alternating optimizing procedure: 1) With resource allocation fixed, power allocation is optimally solved distributively 
utilizing the non-linear Perron-Frobenius Theorem. 2) With power allocation fixed, the resource allocation is updated using
a local search strategy. The designed algorithm is effective in greatly reducing the system outage probability and allocate 
orthogonal resources to links with potentially high mutual interference.

<h3>Interference Mitigation with Queue Stability Consideration</h3>
<p><font color="A52A2A"><b>Keywords: </b>Lyapunov Optimization, Non-convex Optimization, Successive Convex Approximation. </p>
</font><p>
We study the spectrum sharing in heterogeneous networks considering the queue-stability of the victim layer.
Traditional resource scheduling baed on channel condition alone may lead to intolerable user backlogs and frequent
package drops. Based on Lyapunov optimization, we designed algorithms to control the interfering tier power 
adaptively constrained on the queue-stability on the interfered users.
</p>

<h3>Game Theory and Its Applications</h3>
<p><font color="A52A2A"><b>Keywords:</b> Non-cooperative games, auction design, mechanism design, pricing.</font></p>

<p>Some optimization problems in wireless networks can be a natural application of non-cooperative games. By analyzing the convergence
for non-cooperative game based algorithms 
in tiered networks, we can gain insight into when we can adopt non-cooperative mechanisms for sharing communication nodes and when we should use orthogonal
resources. </p>

<p>Another important application of algorithmic game theory is mechanism design in areas like spectrum trading, where the spectrum acts as
a commodity that can be sold to customers (in our case, customers can be user equipments, base-stations, or both). More generally, power or backhaul bandwidth can
 also be viewed as a valuable resource for trading.</p>


<h2>Intern Projects</h2>
<h3>Improving Spectral Efficiency for ad hoc Networks</h3>
<p><font color="A52A2A"><b>Keywords: </b> MIMO, ad hoc networks, link adaptation, joint transceiver design, successive interference cancellation </font></p>
<p>The projects aim at improving the spectral efficiency of ad hoc networks using multiple MIMO techniques. 
By striking a balance among several trade-offs for different techniques, such as power control, beamforming/precoding, interference cancellation, 
link adaptation, spectrum division, etc. simulations have shown more than 50 times gain in terms of spectral efficiency
compared with the baseline. </p>
 
<h3>Processing Field Data for Power Saving Projection of WCDMA+</h3>
<p><font color="A52A2A"><b>Keywords: </b> Perl, script, Data Cleanup, Regular Expression.</font></p>
<p>Processed raw data to project the percentage of power saving for early decoding in WCDMA+.</p>

<h3>Searcher Algorithm Enhancement with Intermittent Scheduling</h3>
<p><font color="A52A2A"><b>Keywords: </b> C++, AGC, WCDMA</font></p>
<p>AGC(Automatic Gain Controller) output may suffer from intermittent up-shooting or down-shooting due to its transient response
during intermittent HSPA scheduling in WCDMA systems.
Algorithm is designed and simulated in C++ to adaptively compensate the spikes. Performance shows that the proposed scheme can
significantly improve searcher performance in terms of false alarm rate while not decreasing the detection rate.
</p>

<h3>Adaptive Taylor Approximation Algorithm for UERS Channel Estimation and Interference Cancellation</h3>
<p><font color="A52A2A"><b>Keywords: </b>LTE, UERS, Interference Cancellation, Channel Estimation, Taylor Approximation </font></p>
<p>
Perform optimization and generate LUT for online parameter basis selection and achieve significantly improvement in terms of MSE (up to 7 dB) 
compared with existing algorithm.

<h2>Course Projects </h2>

   <h3>Simulation Biham-Middleton-Levine (BML) Traffic Model in R</h3>
    <p> <p><font color="A52A2A">
<b>Keywords: </b>
R,  R package, Data Visualization
 </font></p>

<p>As a homework project for an audited statistic programming course (STAT242), 
the simulation is about <q><i>cars moving on a grid</i></q>. As required in the description of the project, we populate the grid by placing cars into a <i>r x c</i> grid.
 It has been found by Bihan <i>et el</i> that the steady-state flow of traffic suddenly went from smooth flow to a complete jam. 
The project aims to practicing writing R packages, vectorized operations in R and S3 methods.
