<h3>Outage Balancing for Femtocell Networks</h3>
<p> <img src="../images/systemModel.png" style="float:right;width:300px;height:220px"> Given channel statistics information either locally at each femtocell base-station (FBS) or 
collected at some control node, we aim at optimizing certain system parameters based on the outage probability for FUEs and MUEs.
In a two-tier heterogenous network, interference comes from both the intra-tier (femto-to-femto, macro-to-macro)
 and cross-tier (femto-to-macro, macro-to-femto). Based on similar model, we managed to solve the following two problems</p>
<ol>
	<li>With resource allocation fixed, jointly optimize the rate allocation and power allocation for each link. </li>
	<li>With rate requirement fixed,  jointly optimizing resource allocation and power allocation for each link. </li>
</ol>
In both cases, we are trying to optimize a network metric based on outage probability, which provide certain fairness among
base-stations as well. While Problem 1 is reduced to a geometric programming problem, Problem 2 is much more challenging 
with a mixed-integer non-convex nature. To tackle the challenge, the joint optimization is decomposed into an iterative 
alternating optimizing procedure: 1) With resource allocation fixed, power allocation is optimally solved distributively 
utilizing the non-linear Perron-Frobenius Theorem. 2) With power allocation fixed, the resource allocation is updated using
a local search strategy. The designed algorithm is effective in greatly reducing the system outage probability and allocate 
orthogonal resources to links with potentially high mutual interference.
