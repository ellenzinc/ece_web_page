<p>
In this blog, I will share with you some of my amateur watercolor paintings on flowers and landscape. 
</p>
<p>
Every year, I would include "try something new" as one item in the new year's resolutions. Last year, it turns out that I ran 12 km for the
first time and this year, the story goes on to drawing  some watercolor paintings to decorate my home!
<p>
Painting is such a relaxing and rewarding creative procedure and it can change the way you see the world!
